# Efficient Log Retrieval System

## 📌 Overview
This script efficiently extracts log entries for a specific date from a **large (1 TB) log file**.  
It is optimized for **memory efficiency and speed** using **multiprocessing** and **chunked file reading**.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**
Ensure you have **Python 3** installed:  
```bash
python3 --version
If not installed, install it:

Ubuntu/Linux: sudo apt install python3
Mac: brew install python3
Windows: Download Python
2️⃣ Download & Extract the Log File
Download the large log file from one of the following links:

🔗 LimeWire Link
🔗 Google Drive Link

After downloading, extract it:

bash
Copy
Edit
unzip logfile.zip
Move the extracted file to the logs/ directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p logs
mv logfile.log logs/
3️⃣ Running the Script
Run the script from the project’s root directory with the date (YYYY-MM-DD):

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/extract_logs.py 2024-12-01
Example Output:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Log extraction complete. Output saved to output/output_2024-12-01.txt
Check the output file:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat output/output_2024-12-01.txt
⚡ How the Script Works
Processes the file in chunks to avoid high memory usage.
Uses multiprocessing to speed up extraction.
Filters logs based on the given date.
Writes results efficiently to minimize disk I/O.
🛠️ Troubleshooting
🔹 Issue: Python command not found
Try using python3 instead of python:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 src/extract_logs.py 2024-12-01
If Python is not installed, install it as shown in Step 1.

🔹 Issue: No logs found for a date
Ensure the log file is correctly placed inside the logs/ folder.
Try searching manually using:
bash
Copy
Edit
grep "2024-12-01" logs/logfile.log
If there are results, but the script doesn’t extract them, check the log format.
🔹 Issue: Output folder not found
If you see an error related to the output/ directory, create it manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p output
